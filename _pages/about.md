My name is Lingyu Yue (岳凌宇). I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Multiscale Mechanics Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering, Université de Montréal (2017-2022).

I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Montreal Polytechnique (2017-2022), my Master's degree in Civial Engineering from École Spéciale des Travaux Publics, du Bâtiment et de l'Industrie (ESTP Paris) (2013-2015), and my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Hohai University (2009-2013).

My research interests focus on multiscale modeling and thermal-mechanical simulation of thermoplastic composite materials, carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite materials forming process simulation, and mechanical property characterization and prediction of thermoplastic polymer materials under harsh service conditions. I specialize in experimental mechanics, time-dependent material mechanics, and computational modeling using Bayesian frameworks. I have published several papers in leading journals including Polymer Composites, Experimental Mechanics, and International Journal of Solids and Structures. I also serve as a peer reviewer for international journals such as Experimental Mechanics and Mechanics of Time-Dependent Materials.
