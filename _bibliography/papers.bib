	abstract = {Background Characterizing the mechanical behavior of materials at elevated temperatures is critical for the design and development of polymer systems for use in complex operating conditions. The commonly used Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) does not apply to the investigation of the three-dimensional properties of materials. A combination of a mechanical testing system and an environmental chamber with extensometer measurements is more suitable for this purpose. However, the bi-axial extensometer suffers errors in measuring strains in thermoplastic specimens at elevated temperatures due to its characteristics.
Objective. This brief technical note analyzes the source of measurement errors with an extensometer and proposes a robust and straightforward experimental procedure for three-dimensional mechanical testing at high temperatures.
Methods. Two temperature and physical aging effects characterization experiments on polycarbonate at 120 ◦C were performed as a case study. Thermal and penetration drifts were analyzed and corrected in the axial and transverse measurements.
Results. The corrected experimental results for the two tests are nearly identical, attesting to the reproducibility of the proposed procedure. Furthermore, the bulk-related strain computed using the corrected strain increases monotonically with time, consistent with the thermodynamic principle, thus demonstrating the reliability of experimental results.
Conclusions. The methodology described in this work can serve as a protocol to guide the three-dimensional thermomechanical testing with a bi-axial extensometer.},

	abstract = {Background: Additive manufacturing enables to print patient-specific Foot Orthotics (FOs). In FOs featuring lattice structures, the variation of the cell’s dimensions provides a locally variable stiffness to meet the therapeutic needs of each patient. In an optimization problem, however, using explicit Finite Element (FE) simulation of lattice FOs with converged 3D elements is computationally prohibitive. This paper presents a framework to efficiently optimize the cell’s dimensions of a honeycomb lattice FO for flat foot condition.
Methods: We built a surrogate based on shell elements whose mechanical properties were computed by the numerical homogenization technique. The model was submitted to a static pressure distribution of a flat foot and it predicted the displacement field for a given set of geometrical parameters of the honeycomb FO. This FE simulation was considered as a black-box and a derivative-free optimization solver was employed. The cost function was defined based on the difference between the predicted displacement by the model against a therapeutic target displacement.
Results: Using the homogenized model as a surrogate significantly accelerated the stiffness optimization of the lattice FO. The homogenized model could predict the displacement field 78 times faster than the explicit model. When 2000 evaluations were required in an optimization problem, the computational time was reduced from 34 days to 10 hours using the homogenized model rather than explicit model. Moreover, in the homogenized model, there was no need to re-create and re-mesh the insole’s geometry in each iteration of the optimization. It was only required to update the effective properties.
Conclusion: The presented homogenized model can be used as a surrogate within an optimization framework to customize cell’s dimensions of honeycomb lattice FO in a computationally efficient manner.},

The results of enthalpy barriers from hybrid first principles calculations validate the rationality and sequence of conjectured reactions during the two-stage carbonization process. Conversion rates of the rate-determining steps under 300 s carbonization are also estimated based on Eyring's transition state theory realizing kinetics equivalency of the reaction extent. Process-control measurements are further demonstrated corresponding to the proposed mechanism. The iterative densified crosslinking scheme specially designed for the surface layer is implanted into the topological reaction molecular dynamics template and a series of highly devisable structural models during the whole evolutionary process from the pre-oxidized fiber to the pristine carbon fiber surface are successfully predicted. The ultimate structure of the model presents excellent similarity in carbon yield and elemental composition with the type II high strength carbon fiber surface.},

	abstract = {The self-heating-induced temperature rise in the adhesive layer under fatigue loading plays a significant role in influencing the fatigue behavior of rivetedbonded hybrid joints in aluminum-carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite structures. This study aims to investigate the impact of the self-heating effect on the fatigue life of such hybrid joints. Experimental analysis was conducted to explore the interrelationships between temperature evolution and fatigue behavior at varying frequencies, adhesive thicknesses, and loading levels. Additionally, a theoretical model for predicting self-heating temperature rise in hybrid joints with different parameters was developed. Results show that the self-heating effect is notably affected by loading frequency, loading level, and adhesive thickness. The theoretical model accurately captures temperature variations and predicts critical frequencies for hybrid joints under different loading levels, which are identified as 10, 8, 3, and 1 Hz for loading levels of 35\%, 40\%, 50\%, and 60\%, respectively. Critical adhesive thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm were also determined. Furthermore, the study predicts the fatigue life at specific self-heating temperatures with an average error within 4\%, offering valuable theoretical insights for evaluating the fatigue safety performance of hybrid joints and facilitating optimization strategies.},

	abstract = {Existing hot stamping simulations are performed at the macroscopic scale, making optimizing process parameters for a new composite system time-consuming. This paper develops a dual-scale three-dimensional thermos-viscoelastic model based on a numerical homogenization approach to accurately predict the structural deformation of thermoplastic composite laminates during hot stamping. The viscoelastic homogenization model is developed on representative volume elements using temperature-dependent viscoelastic parameters determined from thermo-mechanical tests. The effective properties of the composites are identified from the homogenization results, which are then combined with the experimentally measured thermal behavior into a numerical model of the hot stamping process. The developed model is validated by the agreement between the finite element homogenization results and the predictions made using the determined parameters. The simulated warpage of the molded part also agrees well with the experimental measurements. The developed dual-scale model can be used to predict the effective thermomechanical properties of composites. Moreover, it can also be integrated into numerical tools for structural design and process optimization of thermoplastic composites.},

	abstract = {Background: Foot orthotics (FOs) are frequently prescribed to provide comfortable walking for patients. Finite element (FE) simulation and 3D printing pave the way to analyse, optimize and fabricate functionally graded lattice FOs where the local stiffness can vary to meet the therapeutic needs of each individual patient. Explicit FE modelling of lattice FOs with converged 3D solid elements is computationally prohibitive. This paper presents a more computationally efficient FE model of cellular FOs.
Method: The presented FE model features shell elements whose mechanical properties were computed from the numerical homogenization technique. To verify the results, the predictions of the homogenized models were compared to the explicit model’s predictions when the FO was under a static pressure distribution of a foot. To validate the results, the predictions were also compared with experimental measurements when the FO was under a vertical displacement at the medial longitudinal arch.
Results: The verification procedure showed that the homogenized model was 46 times faster than the explicit model, while their relative difference was less than 8\% to predict the local minimum of out-of-plane displacement. The validation procedure showed that both models predicted the same contact force with a relative difference of less than 1\%. The predicted force-displacement curves were also within a 90\% confidence interval of the experimental measurements having a relative difference smaller than 10\%. In this case, using the homogenized model reduced the computational time from 22 h to 22 min.
Conclusion: The presented homogenized model can be therefore employed to speed up the FE simulation to predict the deformations of the cellular FOs.},

Obtaining the numerical values of the terms involved in such constitutive models from experiments is an ill-posed problem in the sense that many parameter sets can adequately ﬁt experimental data. Considering that the computational time involved in the simulation of the response of viscoelastic structures scales with the number of viscoelastic coefﬁcients, it would be of considerable interest to devise identiﬁcation strategies yielding the minimum number of parameters. We propose in this work a framework based on the Bayesian inference to reach this objective. We have applied our methodology to three-dimensional experimental data and validated the obtained constitutive theory on an independent data set, for two different viscoelastic materials. Our results demonstrated the robustness and adequacy of our method.},
